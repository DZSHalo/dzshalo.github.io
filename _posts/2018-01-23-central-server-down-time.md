Unfortunely, our main central server has to shutdown for time being. It may take up to 2 months to resume our server back online. For time being, https://dzshalo.github.io will be an alternate website with no download links for the softwares. It does not means you are permit to upload our softwares online to public.

H-Ext 0.5.3.5 Alpha will most likely available to public in 3 or 4 months once all APIs are finalize and bug fixes.
