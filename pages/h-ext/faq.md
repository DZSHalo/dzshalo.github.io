                                DZS OS SAPP is the first that provide open source base on our decision, plus it is only stable enough to maintenance for limit time. S-Ext is to provide a extension support for other developers, in order to expand third-parties flexibility without cause of conflict between the two.

                                The founder & developer, DZS|All-In-One, has ton of ideas which could not be done all in one day. We only take one at a time to ensure there are no issues with new feature. Basically, we cannot remove "Beta" until we are satisfied with all the features that is added to our Halo Extension along with Add-on interfaces needed to achieve the maximum possibilities for other developers to create their own Add-on easier.

                                We have considered this and has done this in 0.1.4's open source. Then we later decided to establish it as limited source code which only be accessible through Add-on API. Although, after the 2 years of final version (starting from 1.0, not the version releases afterward) we will have it open source except for some closed source Add-on(s) relative to our server and it will be shut down as well for security purposes.

                                No, as result... the answer is always no. Why? All will have identical hooks and may or may not work correctly for any of them. This also includes how the developer's expectation to how it should work as well. Plus they all share same goal. H-Ext is an interface that avoid conflict between two product (Add-on) that need to listen on and allow the compatibility to work correctly.

                                Answer is always yes. We have dozens asking about this and inform them it can. However, some Add-on(s) may or may not work correctly if the halo servers are in the same directory. Please contact them to verify about their product.

                                As usual, our formal expect to work with Halo PC and CE dedicated server. However we have opened our eyes to see Halo Trial does have its identical to PC and CE version due to the blam! engine only has minor changes. So we proceed with support both dedicated server and client. (NOTICE: We are entirely unsure about Halo OS, Open Sauce due to their developer may or may not add a hook cause some conflict with our hooks. Although, we will verify it before we release the first H-Ext.)

                                It is expected to work with Halo Open Sauce and its newer releases, however they both will not be integrated since there are no interference with each other. *****NOTICE: This may subject to change if there are such interference.***** Also, there are some concerned with the additional feature which Halo Open Sauce should not be included as of 3.1 and possible later release. And suggestive to be separated instead of integrating into Halo Open Sauce. (Basically this is ideal to have H-Ext's Add-ons to manage it more better than break the support between two non-communication third-party software as usual.)

                                No, we will never abandon these projects. If we have done this, then it would not be very good for halo community's reputation. As for new features, if they have reached to its final stage, then it's a high chance will be a no. However, we may will consider add a plugin to a project that supports it.

                                Due to H-Ext have transform into PC game versions for both dedicated server and client, we decide not to include this in the main feature. Do not worry about this as we will bring back the GUI support in H-Ext 0.6 or later as seperate dll and will be load automatically if detect the halo is running as dedicated server AND the sgui.dll is in the dll folder. The client may will be using cgui.dll format. However we are still unsure how we should proceed with this yet. We will inform later when we get to 0.6 development plan.

                                Absolutely **NOT**! We don't care what team did to modified the original Halo and redistribute it on the Internet.

                                Yes and no. Due to the price of Halo has NEVER been lowered, which is not an economically standard and being greedy for years now. Yes, Halo is a famous game ever happened to all of us. And we should not be punished for no price drop just like every other games does reduce their price. That would be the reasonabilty of yes. As for no reason, due to pirate copies around the Internet availability to download illegally. However, there are still hackers alternating their hash key which are likely known been used and still stated as ilegit keys. With the bypass of ilegit cd keys verified from GameSpy, it helps the server being more secure. Plus there are some players which is known around us that are using the same and/or pirated keys which does break the safety for the servers.

                                Yes, since this can be done with EXTOnPlayerValidateConnect (May subject to change the name) from the Add-on API to determine if the player and/or admin is validated or not. Although, by default as of H-Ext (including S-Ext) it will still enforce the check with gamespy. (As for offline mode, we are still looking for method to have this supported with gamespy validate.)

* Any of server modications such as Phasor, Gandanur, SAPP, etc.
* Version Changer by Omega (Goemitar)
* Halo Dev Control by jesus7freak (may will be official add-on for his' app to be included since we are very friendly.)
