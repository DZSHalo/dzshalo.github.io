Halo extension, H-Ext, is design to have parallel support for run on Halo client versions of `Trial`, `Combat Evolved`, and `Custom Edition` on PC platform, even dedicated servers too. Other platforms are not supported. With `Add-on API` usage, H-Ext is design to have at least 1 or more mods to run at same time without breaking the game. Since two separate mods attempting to access the same location can cause corruption in Halo.

I.e. Two mods want to provide commands for user to execute it. Yet both do perofrm a hook where console execution function is located. Therefore breaking support between two mods running at same time.

*More coming soon...*
